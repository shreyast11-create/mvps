### Learnings

#### On the Domain: Influencer Monetization
- Revenue depends more on engagement, conversion, and pricing than simply follower count.
- Each revenue stream (ads, affiliate, merch, subscriptions) has unique drivers and risks.
- Diversifying income streams stabilizes earnings; reliance on one source can increase volatility.
- Developed a Conversion Efficiency Ratio (CER) metric to relate engagement and affiliate success.

#### On User Needs
- Minimal, clear inputs and visual outputs make the tool approachable.
- Tooltips, color cues, and benchmarks improve user understanding.
- Actionable insights and context add more value than just the raw numbers.
- Making the template easily copyable encourages experimentation.

#### On MVP Thinking
- Lean process: inputs → calculations → KPIs → charts → insights.
- Google Sheets is effective for rapid prototyping and iteration.
- Organizing by function (Input, Calculations, Dashboard, Insights) enhances clarity.
- Used estimated/simplified benchmarks when data was unavailable.
- Showing only relevant metrics per screen (progressive disclosure) aids focus.

#### Challenges & Decisions
- Separated engagement revenue to avoid misleading total revenue assumptions.
- Balanced visual clarity with transparent formulas.
- Kept the MVP simple by excluding automation and external data.
